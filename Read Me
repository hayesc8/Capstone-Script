Capstone Code ACL Injury Impact Script 
Overview
This project analyzes the impact of ACL injuries on NBA player performance using historical game logs and injury data. It builds predictive models to estimate post-injury performance changes and provides insights through visualizations and feature importance analysis.
________________________________________
Features
•	Data Processing: 
o	Cleans and standardizes NBA game logs.
o	Matches ACL injury records to player IDs(name) using fuzzy matching.
•	Feature Engineering: 
o	Computes pre- and post-injury averages for key stats (PTS, AST, REB, FG%, etc.).
o	Calculates deltas and efficiency metrics.
o	Performs PCA for dimensionality reduction.
•	Modeling: 
o	Baseline: KNN Multi-Output Regression.
o	Advanced: Random Forest Multi-Output Regression with hyperparameter tuning.
•	Evaluation: 
o	Metrics: MSE, R^2, Cross-Validation scores.
o	Visualizations: Actual vs Predicted plots, residual analysis, clustering, correlation heatmap.
•	Interpretability: 
o	Feature importance and permutation importance for Random Forest.

How to Run
Security Note!!!
This code disables SSL certificate verification when fetching data from NBA_api. 
It was done to get around certificate issues I was experiencing and you may want to comment out: 
resp = requests.get(url, verify=False, headers=headers, timeout=10) if you are running the code.
Or to make it easier and prevent breakage change “verify=False” to “verify=True”.
Run
1.	Place the injury dataset (NBA Player Injury Stats(1951 - 2023).csv) in the project directory.
2.	Run the script: 
Shell
python modeling_pipeline_updated.py
Show more lines
3.	Outputs will be saved in: 
4.	model_outputs/
